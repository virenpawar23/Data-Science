A high positive correlation (values near 1) means a good positive trend - if one increases, then the other also increases. A negative correlation on the other hand(values near -1) indicate good negative trend - if one increases, then the other decreases. A value near 0 indicates no correlation, as in one variable doesnâ€™t affect the other. \n",
